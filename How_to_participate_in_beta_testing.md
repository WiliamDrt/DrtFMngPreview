  2. Your Store account e-mail, to become members of the Private Audience that has access to the program
  
  3. The Language(s) you have installed in your system. RTL languages are not yet supported, but I would like to support them. If you do have a Right To Left language, please consider participate in this beta.

After 12 to 24 hours* you will get an email confirming your participation. Get in Store and search for DrtFmngPreview. Install as usual.

## Now What ?

Use the program, [Make Themes](How_to_make_a_theme.md), [Make Icon Packs](How_to_make_an_icon_pack.md). If you encounter a problem, or you have an idea start a new [issue](https://github.com/WilliamDrt/DrtFMngPreview/issues).

Thank you  for your precious help.
