### Change Icon Pack

[Ctrl] + [I] to bring up the Icon Packs window. Just click on one of the available packs (if any). Clicking on "System", resets to default. DrtFMngrPreview reads available packs (files with .drt-iconpack extension) from the following folder:

```
Desktop\YOUR-USERNAME\Documents\DrtFmngPreview\IconPacks
```

`Desktop\YOUR-USERNAME\Documents\DrtFmngPreview folder is hidden. [Ctrl] + [H] brings up Folder Options window. Go to View -> Advanced Settings -> "Show hidden files, folders, or drives". Click Ok.`

### Make New Icon Pack

Make a new folder and name it with your Icon Pack name. For this example "My First Icon Pack".

Inside that folder make a new folder and name it ".mp3". Inside ".mp3" folder, save an image named "Normal.png", size should be 256x256

It should look something like this:

```
My First Icon Pack(folder)
|-> .mp3(folder)
	|->Normal.png`
```

[Ctrl] + [I] to bring up the Icon Packs window. Click the 3 dots (...) button and navigate to your Icon Pack folder, for this example "My First Icon Pack". Click on "Make Icon Pack". A message box will inform you on success or not. If everything was ok a new file named "My First Icon Pack.drt-iconpack" should be inside your pack folder.
